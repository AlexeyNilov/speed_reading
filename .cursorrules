  Key Principles
  - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
  - Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
  - Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
  - Use the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is a design pattern in computer programming that states that every module, class, or function should have only one reason to change. This means that each module should have a well-defined responsibility, and that responsibility should be encapsulated within the module.

  Python
  - Write PEP8 compliant code
  - Annotate functions
  - Write docstrings in Google format

  Testing
  - Write tests for all functions using pytest
  - Use fixtures from test/conftest.py
  - Prefer dependency injection over patching

  Error Handling and Validation
  - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
    - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
    - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
    - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
    - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
    - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
    - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
    - Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
